# DotFiles

My custom dotfiles. Feel free to fork and add customizations, but this is designed for my usage so I'm not likely to accept PRs to add things I don't use or need. I'm definitely open to PRs that help make this more extensible and easier to fork though.

## Some of my favorite tools

Here are some of the tools that I use here. Feel free to use the configs I have, or just grab the tools and check them out yourself!

* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - A cool fuzzy finder. Pipe anything to it and it will give you a UI to do fuzzy searching in the results.
* [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - A terminal UI for git.
* [direnv](https://direnv.net/) - Automatically set and unset environment variables as you move from project to project.
* [All my favorite Homebrew formulae](macos/Brewfile).
* [My VIM config, including plugins](vim/vimrc.vm).
* [My TMUX config](tmux/tmux.conf) which is based on [Oh My tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux).
